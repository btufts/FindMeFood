These days we are bombarded by far too many restaurant options, making the decision on where to eat more complicated than it needs to be. This program enables the user to just put in specifcations of what they want and be given a random place to go to that meets their criteria, simplifying the entire process. If they don't like that place, they can click next to be given a new random restaurant that also meets their criteria.

The work around for cors will sometimes provide an error of there being too many requests. When making a search for resturaunts and getting a return of "No restaurant could be found." could be a result of this issue or there not being an resturaunts that fit the filters. The error of too many requests will show up in console is that is the issue.

In order to get the app to get location of user, the url must use "https://". If not, the site will not request location.
